# Control-Deck
Creating a macro keyboard that does what I want it to do. Uses Circuitpython for the code, and CAD files were made in Fusion and EAGLE. If you want to buy the parts, find them here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RFYX7JZrpwjLwtB7y6xhBlMC7kCXbXWXpSp6u98_VJg

# Files
ControlDeck.f3z - Control Deck file if you want to open it in Fusion.
ControlDeck.stl - Control Deck parts that need printing. I recommend opening it in another 3D software (e.g. Blender) to separate the parts so you can print them one at a time.
ControlDeck.brd - Control Deck PCB file if you want to edit it. To send it to print, you have to open it in a software like EAGLE and export it as a gerber file. (https://www.7pcb.com/blog/how-to-export-gerber-files-from-eagle)
